# Banking Portal with Node & Express
This project is a simple Banking Portal buit with Node & Express. There are seven different routes that will include index, profile, savings, checking, credit, transfer and payment. 
The starter code has been cloned from [here](https://github.com/pluralsight-projects/NodeExpress-BankingPortal).
The app uses Node's built-in `fs` library to read/write data and the Express router to make the application more modular.
